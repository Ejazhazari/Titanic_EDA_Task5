3. Tools Used
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Google colab

4. Dataset Overview
Total Entries: 891

Features: Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked

Target Variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

df.info()
df.describe()
df.isnull().sum()


5. Visualizations & Observations
📊 Survival Count
Observation: More passengers did not survive than those who did.

📊 Passenger Class Count
Observation: Most passengers belonged to the 3rd class.

📈 Age Distribution
Observation: Most passengers were between 20 to 40 years old.

📦 Age vs Survival (Boxplot)
Observation: Younger passengers (especially children) had a higher survival rate.

🌡️ Correlation Heatmap
Observation: Strong positive correlation between Fare and Pclass. Survival is weakly correlated with Pclass and Sex.

📊 Survival Rate by Class
Observation: 1st class passengers had a higher chance of survival.

📊 Survival Rate by Gender
Observation: Females were more likely to survive than males.

📊 Survival Rate by Port of Embarkation
Observation: Passengers who embarked from 'C' had higher survival rates.
